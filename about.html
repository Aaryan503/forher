        <h1>What I feel about you ðŸŒŸ</h1>
        <p>You are stupid and definitely not fucking gorgeous (nahh just kidding, you are)</p>
        <p>Our past has had ups and downs but I have always enjoyed time with you</p>
        <p>Being with you is a ride I never wanna get off, I never get bored talking to you despite your constant blabbering</p>
        <p>The banter, the sarcasm and the late night talks, all of them were what made by day</p>
        <p>I'm sure you know, I'd definitely keep thinking about all of it for multiple days, and I remember every nonsensical thing you say </p>
        <p>Despite me never admitting it, you can sometimes be funny, and your English can sometimes be good (but i'm better at both so fuck you okay)</p>
        <p>You have a really cute squeaky giggle and your blush is the best thing ever</p>
        <p>There's so much more I can say but I've already said it before and also I feel cringe typing it out again</p>
